- __tmp_... vars should be declared before use.
       --> change failable_funcs to contain name AND return type. return type can then later be used to declare tmp vars.
- enumeration suffix of tmp vars should be tracked within currect context/compound_statement
       --> seems to work
- or_on_error shoould be implemented.
       --> started implementig. currently fails when trying to use


- in declaration rule: save current type, so it's available later call expression in the init_declarator_list
- use sample_output.c as what the output should look like
